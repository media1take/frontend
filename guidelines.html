<h1>Omegle Community Guidelines</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-11-15</strong></p>
<p>Omegle was created to provide a platform where people could connect with other people of diverse backgrounds and experiences. Omegle’s Community Guidelines are intended to further that goal by providing clear guidance about what is and isn’t allowed on Omegle. Users should be guided by common sense and an expectation that they should treat their fellow users with respect.</p>

<p>These Community Guidelines apply to your access to and use of the Omegle website and any services offered by Omegle (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). Omegle reserves the right to revise these Community Guidelines at any time for any reason and updates will be posted to the Services. These Community Guidelines are in addition to the Omegle <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>, which also apply to your access to and use of the Services.</p>

<p>Omegle reserves the right to ban (temporarily or permanently) or take other appropriate action with or without notice with respect to any user that engages in conduct that Omegle determines, in its sole discretion, to be inappropriate or harmful, whether or not such conduct is identified below.</p>

<p>If you encounter conduct or content on the Services that you believe violate any of the guidelines below or if you have other safety concerns about the Services, please contact Omegle at <a href="mailto:safety@Omegle.uk.to">safety@Omegle.uk.to</a> and include “Omegle-Safety” in the subject line. While Omegle is not responsible to you as a user for enforcing these Community Guidelines, reports of violations are helpful to Omegle.</p>

<p>Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are also commercially available and may assist you in limiting minors’ access to materials that may be harmful to or inappropriate for minors. There are a number of websites that provide information about such parental control protections, including but not limited to <a href="https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/">https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/</a>.</p>
